Scholars call it the Source — layered beneath stone and root, it pulses in two frequencies: Bits and Bytes.

Bits are sharp, precise, destructive. A Bit-struck flame burns cold.
Bytes are slow, patient, constructive. A Byte-wrought ward outlasts any wall.

Neither is good nor evil. Each is a hammer looking for a nail.
The art is knowing which one to swing.

Three clutchmates were taken because the flank was unwatched.

He stole from the Warchief''s table and fled into the dungeon dark.
If found, he is to be returned. Alive is preferred. Not required.

rivers named, settlements spaced a day''s walk apart.
Something broke the order. No one living remembers what.

ruins that predate the oldest maps, and an unsettling quiet
that deepens the further you walk from the last road.
